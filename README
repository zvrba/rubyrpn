Description
===========

This is a simple programmable RPN calculator written in Ruby.  Users of HP's
calculators will (hopefully :)) feel at home.  The calculator is planned to
support integers, floats, vectors, 2D matrices, lists and variables.

Errors are reported by pushing error messages onto the stack.  Since there is
no string handling, they cannot be mixed up with anything else.

New functions must be implemented in Ruby: developing a full-fledged (User)
interpreter is very time-consuming.  I also deem it as unnecessary as RPL is
a rather user-unfriendly language.
